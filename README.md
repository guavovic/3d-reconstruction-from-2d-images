# 3D Reconstruction from 2D Images

Project focused on building a tool that converts 2D images into 3D models using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

---

## 1. Project Overview

The goal of this project is to reconstruct 3D models from 2D images. The tool applies computer vision and machine learning techniques to infer depth and three-dimensional structure of objects from one or more images.

### Challenges

- A single image does not carry complete information about depth and geometry.
- 3D reconstruction requires advanced techniques to infer the three-dimensional structure from limited data.

## 3. Input Image Guidelines

To get the best results, the input image matters as much as the model. Follow these recommendations:

**Recommended:**

- A single object per image
- Standard front view of the object
- White, monochrome or removed background

**Not recommended:**

- Text on the image
- Multiple objects in one image
- Complex or cluttered background
- Inappropriate imagery, including harmful, offensive or NSFW content
